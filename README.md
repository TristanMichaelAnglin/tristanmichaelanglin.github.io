> Games have always been a strong foundation in my life. Growing up in a “game family” I was raised at the games table, surrounded by a collection that has grown to over 300 board games. This environment didn't just make me a player; it sparked my curiosity for mechanics and balance, eventually leading me to design and build a complete board game of my own.

> My development journey began in high school, where I built my first games in Python on the iPad. After a period studying Computer Science and Engineering (2018–2020)—where I taught myself Java to create Your Dark Side—I realized my true calling was in the creative and technical architecture of game design rather than traditional engineering.

> In 2023, I shifted my focus entirely to Game Development. Immersing myself in this field has been an incredible experience. This passion has fueled me to maintain a 3.85 cumulative GPA while building a portfolio centered on engaging gameplay loops and persistent progression systems.

  <b>2D Dungeon Crawler RPG</b>
  <b>Solo Dev</b>
</div>

> **Project Overview:** This project represents my first deep dive into the RPG genre and complex system architecture. Developed entirely on an iPad, this was an ambitious leap from my previous work, driven by a passion for dungeon crawlers. While the game remains an unfinished prototype, it was the first time I wrestled with—and successfully implemented—interlocking systems like inventory management, class-based stats, and enemy AI. It stands as a proud milestone where my passion for the genre pushed me to teach myself more advanced programming logic.

  <b>2D Survival Endless Scroller</b>
  <b>Solo Dev</b>
</div>

> **Project Overview:** Hit & Run is a Python-based survival game developed on the iPad, designed to explore the fundamentals of game loops, difficulty scaling, and persistent progression systems. Initially conceived as a scrolling game, the project evolved into a stationary survival challenge where players must fend off waves of homing enemies to achieve the highest possible round.

</div>

**Core Contributions**
> **Survival Loop Architecture:** Engineered a stationary combat loop where enemies continuously converge on a fixed player position. I implemented a non-targeting swing mechanic that damages all enemies within a frontal arc, with attack frequency dynamically tied to a "Haste" stat and monitored via a real-time cooldown bar.

> **Persistent Progression:** Engineered a multi-tiered reward system where kills generate XP, Gold, and Rubies. I developed a comprehensive shop and spell framework that allows players to permanently upgrade base stats such as Health, Damage, Lifesteal, Regen, Dodge, and Haste while managing a rare currency economy to unlock and level up abilities.
